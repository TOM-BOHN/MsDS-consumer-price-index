## Abstract
While the CPI news release and charts are thorough, they focus on the top-level CPI number.  This is effective at describing the why behind inflation, but given the amount of aggregation, this package falls short of successfully communicating the “so what” of changes in CPI and inflation to the average person.

Where the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides charts, they tend to fall short.  Either they are too detailed (tables) or too general (bar chart). Something with more focus and less noise in the visualization is needed.

To address this need of citizens and researchers, a chart needs to be created in the middle of these two bookends, focused on addressing the following questions and opportunities:
- What is driving the month-over-month changes?
- Are there offsetting increases and decreases that are obscured in the highly aggregated metric?
- How can I enable a citizen to accurately and efficiently identify expenditure categories driving the CPI number?

## Conclusion
Based on the experiment and the results the new visualization is statistically better in all 3 measurements:
3x more efficient with the time required to complete the comparison
33% more accurate answers to the task’s question
10x fewer interaction to complete the comparison

Overall, the top 10 visualization bar chart developed for the task is accepted as the superior visualization and should be the base for future iterations and experimentation.
